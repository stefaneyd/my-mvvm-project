In this module we are going to discuss the ModelViewViewModel otherwise known as the MVVM design pattern. The ModelViewViewModel design pattern facilitates modern development techniques such as separation of concerns, unit testing and test driven development. As with most design patterns the ModelViewViewModel design pattern is just a set of guidelines that when you follow them it makes it easier to write applications. Use them where they makes sense and modify them to fit the needs of your application at a given point in time.
